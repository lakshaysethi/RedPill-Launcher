# RedPill-Launcher
Android Home Screen Launcher with red pill theme

I am making this for people who want to really simplify and take charge of their phone use
Instead of promoting bad addictive behavior to blue-pill apps
This launcher will make it easier for the users to be more productive
By making it harder to access time wasting apps 
And by making work and self improvement apps more easily accessable


For example by having access to the notes section on your home screen 
You're more likely to make more notes

Also by having easier access to audiobooks/self learning video materials
You are more likely to open them and use them rather than having the dessert apps lieying next to the good ones.
